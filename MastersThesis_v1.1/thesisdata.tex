\gmtdescNOR{This should be in Norwegian, I thought I would add some more text
to make sure that it ran over multiple lines. I will need to check the page
number feild as it probably should be just the core pages without the
appendices.  Currently it returns the last page of the whole document. 
If I cannot work it out, I will provide two inputs, gmtnumberpages and gmtappnumber.
That should do the job.}
