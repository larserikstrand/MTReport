\section{Software engineering decisions}

\subsection{Task collection issues and improvements}
\ldots discuss the ideal case, where there would be tons of data, and that they were indicating that prolonged usage of the app reduced the time spent on tasks. \ldots

- collecting data about users. privacy issues?

\section{Context collection}

The ideal way to track the users contexts during tasks would be an autonomous approach where the users did not have to remember to do so.

- Manual tracking, people forget. Suggestions for an automated approach.

- could have made more rules. Like if a location context changes for a meeting, we might be able to assume that the meeting has ended.

- choice of remote datastore. possible loss of data. discuss alternatives.

- task and context history building up over a very long time may eventually cause the oldest parts of the history to no longer be relevant.
