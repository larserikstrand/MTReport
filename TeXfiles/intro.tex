\chapter*{Abstract}
Task management systems such as Calendars and to-do lists are important tools for many people that helps them to stay organized. These systems are usually quite simple and does not go beyond simply keeping track of the user's events and tasks. This thesis looks at how the usefulness of such systems can be even further improved, by introducing the use of user contexts.

In order to make a task management system utilize contexts, there are many considerations and decisions that has to be made. This thesis study these considerations. We also design a proof of concept to-do list application for mobile devices that is able to collect and use context information. We experiment with the use of a recommender to recommend tasks and an ordering of tasks for a user, based on contexts and previous tasks.
