\gmtdesc{This thesis looks into the design decisions needed to make a task management application that utilizes context information. A to-do list application was developed for mobile devices as a proof of concept. We implemented a recommender to recommend tasks for the user based on the users planned tasks, the current context and the collected contexts of previous completed tasks.}
